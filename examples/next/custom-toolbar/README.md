# Welcome to the Faust Custom Toolbar Example.

## Setup

See the [Getting Started](https://faustjs.org/tutorial/get-started-with-faust) to setup your base Faust project.

## Viewing the Toolbar

To view the toolbar, make sure you have completed the Getting Started steps and then click `Login`. After you are logged in and authenticated you will see the toolbar at the top of the template.

### Troubleshooting

If you don't see the toolbar and have already authenticated, make sure you have `experimentalToolbar` set to `true` in the [faust.config.js](./faust.config.js) file.

## Customize the Example Plugin

To customize the example plugin, go to the [CustomToolbar.tsx](./plugins/CustomToolbar.tsx) and experiment.
